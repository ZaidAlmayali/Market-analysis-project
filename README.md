# Market-analysis-project

Project Background
Vendora is a well-established online retail company known for offering a wide range of products through its e-commerce platform. Despite launching several new online marketing campaigns, the company has recently faced significant challenges, including declining customer engagement and lower conversion rates. Additionally, increased marketing expenses have not translated into the expected return on investment. Understanding customer feedback has also become essential for improving engagement and driving sales.

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive data analysis to uncover actionable insights that can help Vendora refine its marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and boost overall performance.

Focus Areas of Analysis
Customer Engagement Trends:
Analyzing how customers interact with marketing content across various channels to identify the factors contributing to decreased engagement.

Conversion Rate Optimization:
Examining the user journey on the website to identify bottlenecks and recommend strategies to increase conversions.

Marketing Campaign Effectiveness:
Evaluating the performance of recent marketing campaigns to determine their ROI and identify areas where marketing spend can be optimized.

Customer Feedback Analysis:
Performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews and social media comments to better understand customer satisfaction and areas needing improvement.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
Conversion Rate: The percentage of website visitors who complete a purchase.
Customer Engagement Rate: The level of interaction with marketing content (clicks, likes, comments).
Average Order Value (AOV): The average amount spent by customers per transaction.
Customer Feedback Score: The average rating from customer reviews.

Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

Assumptions and Caveats:
Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)

Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)

Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
